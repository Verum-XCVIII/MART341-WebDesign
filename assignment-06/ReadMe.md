### How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

  A HTML page may only contain a single <head> and a single <body> element. The <head> element serves as a container for information the end user will not directly see (excluding the <title>, which will show in the browser tab for the page). The <body> element then contains every single bit of content which will be visible to the end user.

### Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

  Structural markup defines the structure of a webpage, some of which being headings, paragraph, breaks, and list tags. Semantic markup then defines how content (text) is shown, some examples being the bold, strong, italics, emphasis, and definition tags.

### Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

  For this assignment I first started by constructing a general "shell" for my webpage. This means I got the head filled in (excluding title), creating my heading, the image, list (with eight list items each), and link elements, and then completing the contact me section (basically writing all the structural markup). After this I messed a bit with the alignment, spacing, padding, and margins of things, and then finally looked for a recipe to put into the page. After getting all of the content in I messed around with alignment for the image, and then looked through the text for where I could add any semantic markup. Lastly I messed a bit with the padding and line spacing for text before looking up how to change the font style out of curiosity.
