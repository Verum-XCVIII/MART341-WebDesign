1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

  Divs are an element used to group other elements together and possibly apply a class to all contained items. classes are used to identify one or several elements for the purpose of applying the same styling to all elements with the same class. Ids are used to identify elements in the same way classes are, however, ids should be unique, only ever having an id applied to a single element. The main reason they should be kept unique is for the sake of JavaScript integration, as ids are used within JavaScript to reference particular elements. Lastly, spans serve a similar purpose to divs except they are used to group text together rather than other elements.

2. Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using a service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos?

  The biggest disadvantage of hosting videos on services such as YouTube or Vimeo would be the possibility of them getting removed, blocked, blocked in particular countries. Or a less severe disadvantage would simply be the possibility of the service's servers being down, temporarily rendering the video on your website unwatchable.

3. Free Response: What challenges did you have this week? How did you overcome them?

  I can't say I really had any particular difficulties this week, as the content was fairly straightforward. The only problem I had was I didn't know what the instructions were referring to when they said "the 3 Media Arts Logo files", and then I realized that I hadn't been reading the assignment details on Moodle because I assumed they were the same as the PDFs, and I then found the download for said files.

   Also, something new that I had learned was that iframes can be used to embed any webpage, as previously I had thought only things specifically made to be embedded (such as the embed Google Maps or YouTube features) could be embedded. And even more interesting to me was the fact that iframes can embed local webpages, and although I can't currently think of any practical reason to do so, I still find it interesting.
