    <h1>I Am NOT Going to Get Up Today!</h1>
    <h3>By: Doctor Seuss</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>Please let me be.</p>
		<p>Please go away.</p>
		<p>I am Not going to get up today.</p>
		<br />
		<p>The alarm can ring.</p>
		<p>The birds can peep.</p>
		<p>My bed is warm.</p>
		<p>My pillow's deep</p>
		<p>Today's the day I'm going to sleep.</p>
		<br />
		<p>I don't care if kids are getting up</p>
		<p>right now all over town.</p>
		<p>I'm the kid who ISN'T getting up.</p>
		<p>I'm staying down.</p>
		<br />
		<p>All around the world</p>
		<p>they're getting up.</p>
		<p>And that's okay with me.</p>
		<p>Let the kids get up in Switzerland</p>
		<p>...or Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Let the kids get up in Alaska</p>
		<p>...and in China.</p>
		<p>I don't care.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Let the kids get up in Italy.</p>
		<p>Let the kids get up in Spain.</p>
		<p>Let them get up in Massachusetts</p>
		<p>and Connecticut and Main.</p>
		<p>Let the kids get up in London</p>
		<p>and in Paris and Berlin.</p>
		<p>Let them get up all they want to.</p>
		<p>But not me.</p>
		<p>I'm sleeping in.</p>
		<br />
		<p>I've never been so sleepy</p>
		<p>since I can't remember when.</p>
		<br />
		<p>You can take away my breakfast.</p>
		<p>Give my egg back to the hen.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Nobody's going to get me up,</p>
		<p>No matter what he does.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Today's my day for</p>
		<p>WOOZY-SNOOZY</p>
		<p>ZIZZ-ZIZZ</p>
		<p>ZIZZ</p>
		<p>ZAZZ</p>
		<p>ZUZZ.</p>
		<br />
		<p>You can tickle my feet.</p>
		<p>You can shake my bed.</p>
		<br />
		<p>You can pour cold water on my head.</p>
		<p>But you're wasting your time.</p>
		<p>So go away!</p>
		<p>I am NOT going to get up today!</p>
		<br />
		<p>In bed is where I'm going to stay.</p>
		<p>And I don't care what the neighbors say!</p>
		<p>I never liked them anyway.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Let them try to wake me.</p>
		<p>Let them scream and yowl and yelp.</p>
		<p>They can yelp from now till Christmas</p>
		<p>but it isn't going to help.</p>
		<p>My bed is warm.</p>
		<p>My pillow's deep.</p>
		<p>Today's the day I'm going to sleep.</p>
		<br />
		<p>I don't choose to be up walking.</p>
		<p>I don't choose to be up talking.</p>
		<p>The only thing I'm choosing</p>
		<p>is to lie here woozy-snoozing.</p>
		<p>So won't you kindly go away.</p>
		<p>I am NOT going to get up today!</p>
		<br />
		<p>(That was only about half the story, but hopefully that's enough.)</p>
