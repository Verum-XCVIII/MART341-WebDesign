1. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?

  The most frequent form I come across would likely be search bars, as I happen to use different wikis fairly frequently, and because of google of course. Otherwise The password form is of course used frequently for logging into websites, and various websites will frequently have a comments section which uses the text area tag.

2. List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and their usage.

  Text input simply allows for users to submit text, it has the password variant which will hide the input as asterisks, and the text area which provides a larger and easily resizable input area for longer inputs. Selection inputs allow for input with set limited responses, it has the radio buttons which allow for only a single option to be selected, the checkbox allows for multiple selections, and the select box serves the same function as radio buttons, but are significantly more space efficient for when there is a large number of options. Lastly button input either sends information to the server in the forms of user uploaded files or forms, or can be used to call code hosted on a server.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

  This assignment was made a bit differently from my last one, mostly because I didn't have a good idea of what I was making. And since I didn't know what I was making I couldn't really create a skeleton/framework before filling it in, so instead I worked linearly from top to bottom. I started with getting my image and contact information positioned, aligned, and styled, then I got my table section aligned created some images to put into this section then styled it and adjusted the positioning. Next I Positioned and aligned the elements in my user comment submission area, worked on the elements themselves and then styled them, and then lastly I went back and tweaked the alignment throughout. The I deciding to find out how to have my text area display how many characters are left until the max length, found some code, put it into my page, and then aligned it.
