# Kalen Weinheimer's MART341-WebDesign
Repository for MART 341 (Intro to Web Design) course.

For this second week of Into to Web Design I learned about directories, different types of files, file naming conventions, how to create a GitHub repository, how to create a new file on GitHub, including a readme file, and how to upload a file to GitHub. I then awnsered the questions posed in the homework 2 assignment, and finally wrote this.
